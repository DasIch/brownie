    Return successive `r` length permutations of elements in the `iterable`.

    If `r` is not specified or is ``None``, then `r` defaults to the length of

    Permutations are emitted in lexicographic sort order. So, if the input
    `iterable` is sorted, the permutation tuples will be produced in sorted
    order.

    Elements are treated as unique based on their position, not on their
    value. So if the input elements are unique, there will be no repeating
    value in each permutation.

    The number of items returned is ``n! / (n - r)!`` when ``0 <= r <= n`` or

    Cartesian product of input iterables.

    Equivalent to nested for-loops in a generator expression. For example,
    ``product(A, B)`` returns the same as ``((x, y) for x in A for y in B)``.

    The nested loops cycle like an odometer with the rightmost element
    advancing on every iteration. The pattern creates a lexicographic ordering
    so that if the input's iterables are sorted, the product tuples are emitted
    in sorted order.

    To compute the product of an iterable with itself, specify the number of
    repetitions with the optional `repeat` keyword argument. For example,
    ``product(A, repeat=4)`` means the same as ``product(A, A, A, A)``.

    `iterable` is sorted, the combinations tuples will be produced in sorted
    order.

    Elements are treated as unique based on their position, not on their value.
    So if the input elements are unique, the generated combinations will also
